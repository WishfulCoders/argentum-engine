/**
 * Snuff Out — Mercadian Masques #162
 * {3}{B} · Instant · Common
 *
 * If you control a Swamp, you may pay 4 life rather than pay this spell's mana cost.
 * Destroy target nonblack creature. It can't be regenerated.
 *
 * The alternative cost is a [SelfAlternativeCost] of {0} plus a 4-life additional cost (the
 * Fireblast shape), gated by its own availability [SelfAlternativeCost.condition] — "if you control
 * a Swamp" is checked when the spell is cast, against any land with the Swamp subtype (Blasphemous
 * Edict's conditional alternative). The spell is the Terror shape without the nonartifact clause.
