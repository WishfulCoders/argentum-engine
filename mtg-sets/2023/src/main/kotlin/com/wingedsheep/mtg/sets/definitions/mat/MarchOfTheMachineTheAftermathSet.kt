/**
 * March of the Machine: The Aftermath (2023)
 *
 * A 50-card epilogue set to March of the Machine, sold in its own Set and Collector Boosters.
 * Scaffolded to hold the canonical definitions of cards it printed first. It is an extension
 * set — too thin to carry a limited pool on its own — and is incomplete until all 50 are in.
 *
 * Set Code: MAT
 * Release Date: May 12, 2023
