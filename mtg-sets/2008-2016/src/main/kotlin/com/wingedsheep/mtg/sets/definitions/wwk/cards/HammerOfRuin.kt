/**
 * Hammer of Ruin — Worldwake #124
 * {2} · Artifact — Equipment
 *
 * Equipped creature gets +2/+0.
 * Whenever equipped creature deals combat damage to a player, you may destroy target Equipment
 * that player controls.
 * Equip {2}
 *
 * "That player" is the damaged player: the ATTACHED damage trigger carries the same
 * `TriggerContext.fromEvent` as a self-bound one, so `controlledByTriggeringPlayer()` scopes the
 * target exactly as on Rustmouth Ogre. The target is chosen when the trigger goes on the stack; the
 * "you may" is the resolution-time choice, hence [Effects.May] around the destroy.
