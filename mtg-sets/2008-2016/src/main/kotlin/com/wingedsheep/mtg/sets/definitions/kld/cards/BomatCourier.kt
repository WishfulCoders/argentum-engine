/**
 * Bomat Courier — Kaladesh #199
 * {1} · Artifact Creature — Construct · 1/1 · Rare
 *
 * Haste
 * Whenever this creature attacks, exile the top card of your library face down. (You can't look
 * at it.)
 * {R}, Discard your hand, Sacrifice this creature: Put all cards exiled with this creature into
 * their owners' hands.
 *
 * Modelling notes:
 * - The attack trigger exiles into this creature's own linked-exile pile, face down and hidden, so
 *   each Courier keeps its own cache (first ruling) and a new object after a zone change has none
 *   (second ruling).
 * - The pile is still read after the Courier is sacrificed as a cost, the same shape as Synod
 *   Sanctum. "Their owners' hands" runs once per distinct owner of the exiled cards, each moving
 *   only the cards they own.
 * - "Discard your hand" is payable with an empty hand (third ruling) — [Costs.DiscardHand].
