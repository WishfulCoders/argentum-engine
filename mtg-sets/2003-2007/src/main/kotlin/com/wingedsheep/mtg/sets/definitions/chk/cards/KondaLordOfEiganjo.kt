/**
 * Konda, Lord of Eiganjo
 * {5}{W}{W}
 * Legendary Creature — Human Samurai
 * 3/3
 * Vigilance, indestructible
 * Bushido 5 (Whenever this creature blocks or becomes blocked, it gets +5/+5 until end of turn.)
 *
 * Vigilance and indestructible are engine-live keywords, so they stay a plain `keywords(…)`
 * declaration. Legendary is carried by the type line — `TypeLine.parse` reads the supertype.
 *
 * **Bushido is lowered here, not handled by the engine.** [KeywordAbility.bushido] is display-only
 * vocabulary — nothing in the rules engine reads `Keyword.BUSHIDO` — so the ability it abbreviates is
 * wired explicitly, following `mh2/cards/JadeAvenger.kt`. CR 702.45a defines bushido N as one
 * triggered ability; the SDK has no single event covering "blocks or becomes blocked" from the
 * source's point of view, so it is written as two triggers over the two distinct events. They are
 * mutually exclusive in any one combat — Konda either declares a block or is blocked, never both —
 * so the +5/+5 never doubles.
 *
 * The pump targets [EffectTarget.Self] rather than `TriggeringEntity` because `Triggers.self.blocks()` fires
 * off a block event that does not bind the source as the triggering entity.
