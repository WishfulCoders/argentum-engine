/**
 * Crush Underfoot
 * {1}{R}
 * Kindred Instant — Giant
 * Choose a Giant creature you control. It deals damage equal to its power to target creature.
 *
 * Two decisions at two different times, and the card is only right if they stay apart:
 *
 *  - **"target creature"** is a printed target, declared when Crush Underfoot goes on the stack
 *    (index 0), so shroud/hexproof/protection are checked at announcement and the spell fizzles
 *    if the creature is gone on resolution.
 *  - **"Choose a Giant creature you control"** is *not* a target. It is picked mid-resolution by
 *    [SelectTargetEffect], after priority has passed — so an opponent can't respond to which
 *    Giant you picked, and the choice is made against the board as it stands when the spell
 *    resolves rather than as it stood when you cast it.
 *
 * The chosen Giant lands in the resolution pipeline's `crushGiant` collection, which the damage
 * step then reads twice: [EffectTarget.PipelineTarget] for "equal to its power" (the generic
 * `storedCollections` reader — the linter pairs it with `SelectTarget.storeAs`) and
 * [EffectTarget.PipelineTarget] as the `damageSource`, so the damage is dealt *by the Giant*.
 * That distinction is load-bearing: it makes the damage red-creature damage rather than spell
 * damage, so lifelink, deathtouch, and "prevent all damage a creature would deal" all read off
 * the Giant.
 *
 * Both zero-Giant and zero-power cases fizzle gracefully. With no Giant to choose, the select
 * step stores an empty collection and [DealDamageEffect] skips the whole instruction rather than
 * falling back to Crush Underfoot itself as the source (CR 608.2b); a 0-power Giant deals no
 * damage because the amount is not positive.
 *
 * Known deviation: the Giant is found through the engine's `TargetFinder`, which filters out
 * permanents with shroud. Because the Giant is *chosen* and not targeted, the rules would let you
 * pick a Giant you control that has shroud. Hexproof is unaffected (you control it), so this only
 * bites the vanishingly rare "my own Giant has shroud" board.
 *
 * "Kindred Instant — Giant" is the 2024 errata of the printed "Tribal Instant — Giant": the card
 * has the Giant creature type in every zone, so it is itself fetched by Lorwyn's Giant-matters
 * cards (Ancient Amphitheater, Boldwyr Intimidator).
