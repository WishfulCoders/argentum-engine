/**
 * Nagao, Bound by Honor
 * {3}{W}
 * Legendary Creature — Human Samurai
 * 3/3
 * Bushido 1 (Whenever this creature blocks or becomes blocked, it gets +1/+1 until end of turn.)
 * Whenever Nagao attacks, Samurai creatures you control get +1/+1 until end of turn.
 *
 * The attack trigger is `Triggers.self.attacks()` (a SELF binding — it fires only when Nagao himself is
 * declared as an attacker) over a group pump. The printed wording says "Samurai *creatures* you
 * control", so the group filter is `Creature.withSubtype(SAMURAI).youControl()` rather than a bare
 * permanent filter — the same spelling `chk/cards/CallToGlory.kt` uses for the identical phrase, and
 * the same shape Assay compiles (`ForEach` over an `IterationSpace.Group` whose body is
 * `ModifyStats` on the iterated entity). Nagao is a Samurai creature himself, so he pumps too.
 *
 * **Bushido is lowered here, not handled by the engine.** [KeywordAbility.bushido] is display-only
 * vocabulary — nothing in the rules engine reads `Keyword.BUSHIDO` — so the ability it abbreviates is
 * wired explicitly, following `mh2/cards/JadeAvenger.kt`. CR 702.45a defines bushido N as one
 * triggered ability; the SDK has no single event covering "blocks or becomes blocked" from the
 * source's point of view, so it is written as two triggers over the two distinct events. They are
 * mutually exclusive in any one combat, so the pump never doubles.
 *
 * The bushido pump targets [EffectTarget.Self] rather than `TriggeringEntity` because
 * `Triggers.self.blocks()` fires off a block event that does not bind the source as the triggering entity.
