/**
 * Nezumi Ronin
 * {2}{B}
 * Creature — Rat Samurai
 * 3/1
 * Bushido 1 (Whenever this creature blocks or becomes blocked, it gets +1/+1 until end of turn.)
 *
 * **Bushido is lowered here, not handled by the engine.** [KeywordAbility.bushido] is display-only
 * vocabulary — nothing in the rules engine reads `Keyword.BUSHIDO` — so the ability it abbreviates is
 * wired explicitly, following `mh2/cards/JadeAvenger.kt`. CR 702.45a defines bushido N as one
 * triggered ability; the SDK has no single event covering "blocks or becomes blocked" from the
 * source's point of view, so it is written as two triggers over the two distinct events. They are
 * mutually exclusive in any one combat, so the pump never doubles.
 *
 * The pump targets [EffectTarget.Self] rather than `TriggeringEntity` because `Triggers.self.blocks()` fires
 * off a block event that does not bind the source as the triggering entity.
