/**
 * Devoted Retainer
 * {W}
 * Creature — Human Samurai
 * 1/1
 * Bushido 1 (Whenever this creature blocks or becomes blocked, it gets +1/+1 until end of turn.)
 *
 * **Bushido is lowered here, not handled by the engine.** [KeywordAbility.bushido] is display-only
 * vocabulary — nothing in the rules engine reads `Keyword.BUSHIDO` — so the ability it abbreviates is
 * wired explicitly, following `mh2/cards/JadeAvenger.kt`. CR 702.45a defines bushido N as one
 * triggered ability, "Whenever this creature blocks or becomes blocked, it gets +N/+N until end of
 * turn"; the SDK has no single event covering both directions from the source's point of view, so it
 * is written as two triggers over the two distinct events. They are mutually exclusive in any one
 * combat — the Retainer either declares a block or is blocked, never both — so the pump never doubles.
 *
 * The pump targets [EffectTarget.Self] rather than `TriggeringEntity` because `Triggers.self.blocks()` fires
 * off a block event that does not bind the source as the triggering entity.
