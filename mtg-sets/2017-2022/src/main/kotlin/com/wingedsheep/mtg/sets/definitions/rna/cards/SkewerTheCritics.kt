 * Sorcery
 * Spectacle {R} (You may cast this spell for its spectacle cost rather than its mana cost if an

 * Skewer the Critics deals 3 damage to any target.
 *
 * Spectacle is exactly its CR 702.137a definition: "You may pay [cost] rather than pay this
 * spell's mana cost if an opponent lost life this turn" — a [SelfAlternativeCost] gated on
 * [Conditions.OpponentLostLifeThisTurn], the same gated-alternative shape as Blasphemous Edict. The
 * gate reads the turn's life-loss tracker, so an opponent who lost life and then gained more still
 * counts (ruling), and it changes only the cost, never when the sorcery can be cast.
