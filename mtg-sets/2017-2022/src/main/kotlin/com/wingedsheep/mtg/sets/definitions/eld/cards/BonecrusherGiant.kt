/**
 * Bonecrusher Giant // Stomp
 * {2}{R} Creature — Giant 4/3 // {1}{R} Instant — Adventure
 *
 * Bonecrusher Giant: Whenever this creature becomes the target of a spell, this creature deals 2
 * damage to that spell's controller.
 * Stomp: Damage can't be prevented this turn. Stomp deals 2 damage to any target.
 *
 * The trigger is [Triggers.self]`.becomesTarget(spellsOnly = true)` — abilities don't fire it — and
 * the damage goes to [Player.ControllerOfTargetingSource], the controller of the spell that did the
 * targeting. It resolves before that spell, and even if the spell is later countered (ruling
 * 2019-10-04). Stomp is [Effects.DamageCantBePreventedThisTurn] followed by the 2 damage, the same
 * shape as Impractical Joke; the adventure() block gives the exile-then-cast-later behaviour.
