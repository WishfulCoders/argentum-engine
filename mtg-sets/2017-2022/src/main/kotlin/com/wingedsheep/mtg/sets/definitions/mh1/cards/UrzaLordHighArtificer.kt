/**
 * Urza, Lord High Artificer
 * {2}{U}{U}
 * Legendary Creature — Human Artificer
 * 1/4
 * When Urza enters, create a 0/0 colorless Construct artifact creature token with "This token gets
 * +1/+1 for each artifact you control."
 * Tap an untapped artifact you control: Add {U}.
 * {5}: Shuffle your library, then exile the top card. Until end of turn, you may play that card
 * without paying its mana cost.
 *
 *  - The Construct counts itself, so it is at least 1/1 (2022-12-08 ruling); its buff is the same
 *    self-scoped [GrantDynamicStats] Karn, Scion of Urza's Construct carries.
 *  - The mana ability taps any untapped artifact — Urza himself is not one — including an artifact
 *    creature that came under your control this turn: tapping it is a cost of Urza's ability, not a
 *    {T} ability of the artifact (CR 302.6 applies only to {T}/{Q} costs of the creature's own).
 *  - The {5} ability's card may be played only this turn and with its normal timing; a land needs
 *    an available land play. Unplayed, it stays in exile.
