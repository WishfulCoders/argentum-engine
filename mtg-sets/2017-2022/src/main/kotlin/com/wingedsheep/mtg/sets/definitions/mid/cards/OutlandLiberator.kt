/**
 * Outland Liberator // Frenzied Trapbreaker (Innistrad: Midnight Hunt)
 * {1}{G}
 * Creature — Human Werewolf // Creature — Werewolf
 *
 * Front — Outland Liberator (2/2): "{1}, Sacrifice this creature: Destroy target artifact or
 * enchantment." Daybound.
 * Back  — Frenzied Trapbreaker (3/3): the same sacrifice ability, plus "Whenever this creature
 * attacks, destroy target artifact or enchantment defending player controls." Nightbound.
 *
 * "Defending player" in the attack trigger is the player this creature attacks (CR 506.2,
 * 802.2a), read off the source's own combat — [Player.DefendingPlayer] through a referenced-player
 * controller scope, as on Necrite — so in a multiplayer game an opponent it isn't attacking
 * isn't a legal choice. The back face has no mana cost; its colour comes from a colour indicator.
