/**
 * The life a mana ability costs to activate — the one place that adds it up:
 *  - the **printed** part: a [CostAtom.PayLife] in the ability's own cost (Mana Confluence's
 *    "{T}, Pay 1 life: Add one mana of any color");
 *  - the **tax**: "mana abilities of this land cost an additional N life to activate" (Thran Portal,
 *    [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.ManaAbilitiesCostAdditionalLife]), a projected Layer 6 value
 *    ([com.wingedsheep.engine.mechanics.layers.ProjectedState.getManaAbilityLifeTax]) that
 *    disappears with the permanent's abilities and covers printed, intrinsic and granted abilities.
 *
 * Every place a mana ability is activated consults it here:
 *  - the manual pipeline (legal-action enumeration and the activation lookup) sees the printed
 *    atom already and folds the tax in via [withTax], so the ordinary cost payer charges the life
 *    and refuses the activation when it can't be paid (CR 119.4);
 *  - the auto-pay solver prices life-costing sources as pain sources and drops an ability whose
 *    life its controller can't pay ([ManaSolver.findAvailableManaSources]);
 *  - every auto-pay path that taps a solver- or player-chosen source charges it with [pay] (or
 *    [tapForManaPayingLife], the tap-and-charge pair) — the fast path skips the activation
 *    pipeline, so without this the life is silently never paid.
