/**
 * Runs the non-mana side effects of an activated mana ability when a source is
 * auto-tapped to pay a cost.
 *
 * Auto-tap fast paths (e.g. spell casting, cycling, combat tax) bypass the normal
 * activated-ability flow: they tap the source and credit its produced mana directly
 * to the payment, skipping the [com.wingedsheep.engine.handlers.actions.ability.ActivateAbilityHandler].
 * For most lands that's correct — the ability is just "{T}: Add {X}" — but pain
 * lands like Adarkar Wastes carry damage as part of the ability's effect
 * (`{T}: Add {W} or {U}. This land deals 1 damage to you.`). Without this helper
 * that damage is silently lost.
 *
 * The helper finds the activated mana ability that matches the produced color and
 * executes everything in its effect chain *except* the mana-producing pieces
 * (which the auto-tap path has already accounted for).
