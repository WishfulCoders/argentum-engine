 * A self-contained gym environment the service layer can drive uniformly.
 *
 * Two implementations exist:
 * - [GameGymEnv] — a game of Magic (wraps [GameEnvironment]).
 * - [com.wingedsheep.gym.deckbuild.DeckbuildEnvironment] — turning a sealed pool into a deck.
 *
 * Each env owns its own action bookkeeping: `observe` produces the observation an agent
 * acts on, and `step` resolves an action ID *from the most recent observation* and advances.
 * Game-specific operations (decision submission, snapshot/restore, reset) live on
 * [GameGymEnv] only; the service casts when it needs them.
