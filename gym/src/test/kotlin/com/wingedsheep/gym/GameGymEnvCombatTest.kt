/**
 * Combat and spell-targeting over the gym's action contract.
 *
 * The enumerator offers exactly one `DeclareAttackers` action, carrying an **empty** attacker map —
 * the choice of who attacks (and whom) rides in `validAttackers` / `validAttackTargets`, not in the
 * action. Stepping it by ID alone therefore declares no attackers: a legal move, an accepted step,
 * and a permanently attack-free game. That is what made combat unreachable through the gym API
 * while every request looked successful, so these tests are the guard on `ActionParams` closing it.
 *
 * The same template shape covers blocks, a spell's targets, and X — one test per `ActionParams`
 * field, so no branch of [ActionParameterizer] is unexercised.
